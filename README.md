My team's project for this year's HackAtHome event. Even though we didn't win I'm still proud of what we managed to do in 42 hours and it was an amazing experience.

FTraffic is a traffic management system using neural networks. Cameras placed around the city would use object detection to determine if the amount of cars in an area goes over a certain threshold, if it does it would optimize the nearby traffic lights in order to resolve the traffic jam as quickly as possible.

The data would then be displayed in an app available to emergency services, and would calculate the fastest route from A to B, avoiding all possible traffic jams.

You can read more about the project in our detailed report below!

Awesome experience and I can't wait to participate in future hackathon events!
